In the C.50 model I've completed the whole project. The final prediction for 500 new customers
and the revenue to be generated from it is also calculated. 

For the other machine learning algorithms, I haven't predicted the class for the 500 new 
customers as it can be done easily. It is similar to the process shown in the C5.0 code.

So, I leave it upto you, how you want to complete it.

If you get better results, please share.

Thank You
