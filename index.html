        <p><strong># Machine Learning Algorithms using R</strong></p>

<p>In this project I've tried to implement most of the machine learning techniques. </p>

<p>I have used Decision Tree (C5.0), Random Forest, K- Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Artificial Neural Network and Naive-Bayes Algorithms.</p>

<p>All the techniques are implemented on a single project. The project deals with categorical data i.e. the predictors and the response variables , all are categorical in nature. This model also helped me to compare the accuracy each model provides for handling this type of dataset.</p>

<p>The project is about an Automobile company planning to launch its existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5) into a new market. Consumer behavior of new market is similar to the existing market. The company is having consumer data of its existing customers and 500 new customers have been identified in the new market who may buy its products. The marketing manager has clear understanding that it is the income level which drives the purchase of different cars. The Manager has also decided the income groups of the existing customers. So, he decided to run different campaigns for different income groups. Based on his prior experience, he could estimate the cost of loss of goodwill if he runs one campaign for a segment of customer for which the campaign is not meant for. </p>

<p>So, as a Data Analyst we have to help the manager to target right customers with right campaign for the new customers i.e. predict
the income group of the new customers. Also, estimate the expected revenue.</p>

<p>Also updated with SVM technique.</p>
