The project deals with categorical data i.e. the predictors and the response variables , all are categorical in nature. This model also helped me to compare the accuracy each model provides for handling this type of dataset.\r\n\r\nThe project is about an Automobile company planning to launch its existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5) into a new market. Consumer behavior of new market is similar to the existing market. The company is having consumer data of its existing customers and 500 new customers have been identified in the new market who may buy its products. The marketing manager has clear understanding that it is the income level which drives the purchase of different cars. The Manager has also decided the income groups of the existing customers. So, he decided to run different campaigns for different income groups. Based on his prior experience, he could estimate the cost of loss of goodwill if he runs one campaign for a segment of customer for which the campaign is not meant for. \r\n\r\nSo, as a Data Analyst we have to help the manager to target right customers with right campaign for the new customers i.e. predict\r\nthe income group of the new customers. Also, estimate the expected revenue.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
